Work in progress.

You need to add 3 folders inside your "images" folder :

"card", "perso" and "tresor"

An image MUST be a .png and MUST be named after the _id of the card/character/treasure concerned.

For example, the _id of your character is 45g8rezg1r9eg5

Your image must be 45g8rezg1r9eg5.png and be placed in src/images/perso.
